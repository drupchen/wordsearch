Glottals: (at the beginning, inside, at the end)

(at the beginning, inside) Glottal's are legal within words as accentuations, and are more commonly written with the standard single quote.

This makes it difficult (without an existing dictionary) to ascertain which are parts of a word, as opposed to being layout for quotations.

Sample words with glottal marks include:

    'Otua
    fakau'a
    fe'ao
    'Ene'io
    
A simplified rule is to retain all uses of single-quotes bounded by legitimate characters. Glottals at the beginning of a word will need to be verified with a dictionary

(at the end) Observations of using Glottal's at the end of a word are either closing of a quotation, or another form of notation to determine the preceeding vowel needs to be accentuated.
