    wordsearch.py - generate word search (word find) puzzles
    
SYNOPSIS

    wordsearch.py [ option ] [ pathname ]

DESCRIPTION

    Word search puzzles are pen and paper puzzles containing a grid of letters. The player's task is to locate words hidden within this grid. Each word is in a straight line, but can be placed in any direction, horizontally (left to right, or right to left), vertically (upwards or downwards), or diagonally. Just to make the puzzle that little bit more difficult, words may overlap orintersect, and of course not every letter in the grid is actually part of a word. 
    
Mandatory arguments for long options are mandatory for short options too
    
I tried to make the command-line help screen (wordsearch.py --help) legible, but there's a formatting problem.

OPTIONS

    The options may be given in any order, before or after pathname.
    
--article
    
    Only useful with --format=html.
    
    Reprints the content of pathname with the words placed in the puzzle _highlighted_
    
-g GRID_SIZE, --gridsize=GRID_SIZE

    GRID_SIZE is the row and column size for the puzzle. For example:
    
    --gridsize=10 11

-o OUTPUTPATH, --outputpath=OUTPUTPATH

    If not specified, the program output is sent to the screen.
    
    Use the output path if your puzzle uses non-ascii characters.

-f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT

    FORMAT specifies [ html | unicode | xml ] the output format of the generated puzzle. For example
    
    --format=html
    
    The default is 'unicode'
    
-m MINIMUMWORDLENGTH, --minimumwordlength=MINIMUMWORDLENGTH

    The minimum length of a word to be included in the puzzle.

-d DIRECTIONS, --directions=DIRECTIONS

    Set the directions words are placed in the puzzle. Adding the value of the directions together gives the combination of directions.
    
    DIRECTIONS    [1|2|4|8|16|32|64|128].
        1.  Left to Right
        2.  Right to Left
        4.  Up
        8.  Down
        16. Diagonal Up to Left
        32. Diagonal Up to Right
        64. Diagonal Down to Left
        128.Diagonal Down to Right
        
        For example, the following values give the set direction combinations:
        
        9   Right[1] + Down[8] (default);
        11  Right[1] + Left[2] + Down[8];
        143 Right[1] + Left[2] + Down[8] + Up[4] + DiagDwnRight[128];
        255 All Directions

-l LEVEL, --level=LEVEL

    Level of Difficulty [1-5]. A simplified amalgamation of directions.
    
            Level 1 [9]  (Basic - default) Left to Right and Down,
            Level 2 [137](Sweet) Right, Down, DiagDwnRight
            Level 3 [143](Challenger) Right, Left, Down, Up, DiagDwnRight
            Level 4 [175](Try Me) Right, Left, Down, Up, DiagDwnRight, DiagUpRight
            Level 5 [255](All Out) All Directions
