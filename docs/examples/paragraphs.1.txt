wordsearch.py generates 'wordsearch' or 'word find' printable paper puzzles,
containing words in a grid.

Word search puzzles are pen and paper puzzles containing a grid of letters. 
The player's task is to locate words hidden within this grid. Each word is 
in a straight line, but can be placed in any direction, horizontally (left to 
right, or right to left), vertically (upwards or downwards), or diagonally. 
Just to make the puzzle that little bit more difficult, words may overlap or
intersect, and of course not every letter in the grid is actually part of a
word.
