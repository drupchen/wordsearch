The ./lang routines are primarily bourne out of my need to get
Tongan Language material working correctly. Some of the choices
in the wordsearch.py routines that require 'language' attention
include:

   * lowercase
   * non-ascii characters (unicode)
   * what letters are legal in a word
   * special characters

Lowercase
------------------------------

I want my puzzles to use lowercase letters, but I want the freedom
to enter the words in whatever case is appropriate for their input.

The language utils need to be able to change case of text to lowercase.
The python standard string library provides a .lower() and .upper() 
function for string conversion. But there's no standard for non-ascii
letters.

Non-ascii characters (Unicode)
------------------------------

The real world uses letters beyond the ASCII character set. I want to
use them where appropriate, and the language utils to manage the
non-ascii characters.

What words are legal in a word
------------------------------

What is a word ?

We'll not try to define what are legal words, but try to define what
are basic letter constructs legal for a word.

No, we're not going into seriously linguistic things here (like
'u' after 'q' in English.) Just basic stuff to keep the utils
codeable.

If you must, please add more functionality.

Special Characters
------------------------------

Some languages (like Tongan/Hawai'ian) have special characters that
not only derive different meanings but also have unique handling
requirements.
